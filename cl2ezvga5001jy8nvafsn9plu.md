## Stoicism of the day | 25-Apr-2022

> "If anyone can prove and show to me that I think and act in error, I will gladly change it -- for I seek the truth, by which no one has ever been harmed. The one who is harmed is the one who abides in deceit and ignorance." - Marcus Aurelius, Mediations

I think we could all take this to heart, especially in relation to our political beliefs. I've drawn a pretty hard line in the sand and have entrenched myself in my beliefs more and more every year. A lot of that entrenchment has to do with the realities of where we get our news and the people that we surround ourselves with, but it also has to do with the hurt I've endured from realizing some of the beliefs my family holds. 

I am going to make a promise today to try and remain more open about the possibility that I am wrong about something, and if proven to be wrong, I will change my mind. Being able to admit that you were wrong about something and changing is growth - and it's how we build a better society.
