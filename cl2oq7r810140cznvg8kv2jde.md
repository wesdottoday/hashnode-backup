## Writing Daily

There’s a lot of value in publishing often. I have a lot of thoughts on what to write about but often struggle to put things out. I want to write 300+ words each day to be published. This could be about any topic I’m interested in:

- Indoor Air Quality
- Tech
- Living life on your own terms 
- Employment Practices
- Politics

You can read, or not, since this is more about working on my writing. I would like to do this for the next 90 Days and see how it turns out.
